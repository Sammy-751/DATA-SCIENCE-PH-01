## Overview

In order to determine the variables that affect severity of accidents, this research analysis examines data on aircraft accidents. The initiative offers data-driven insights to enhance aviation safety and investment choices by looking at aircraft specs, Flying phases amongst other variable.

## Business Understanding

Investors, regulators and airlines all have serious concerns about the safety of air travel. It is beneficial to comprehend the trends in aircraft accidents. This hellps determine which aircraft models are most and least likely to have serious accidents.
It also aids in examining how flying phases and weather affect the results of accidents. Moreover, making risk-based suggestions for aviation ploicy changes and Investments for the organization.

## Data Understanding
## Source of Data

The dataset is sourced from aviation accidents reports which was compiled by the regulatory body, [National Transportation Safety Body](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/home.aspx) (NTSB).

## Description of Data.
Several features pertaining to aircraft accidents are included in the dataset. These features include but not limited to the various aircraft specs, i.e The Make, Model, Number of Engines . The Number of people Injured in aircraft accidents and Uninjured during flights. The details of accidents, say The location of the accident, when the Event Date and Flight Phase of the event.

The Top Thirty Aircraft Models in the market with the highest numbers of casualties across the years are the ones listed in the grapg.
"737" recording the highest metrics , "152" coming in second , "172" in third and a tie between "172N" and "PA-28-140". "G-164A", "G-164B" and "172S" having the lowest records. The organisation is able to see the aircrafts that are to be paid more attention to as the have highest records of passengers injured.

The graph is a trend analysis grapgh. It shows the number of total people who have been injured over the years is reducing over time though there are fluctuations in the numbers indicating further thorough measures are to be put in place to reduce the numbers. So is the number of people Uninjured. 
The numbers are also shifting indicating there's still more things to be investigated like if the number of people taking flights is reducing or increasing over the years.

The number of people who are injured and uninjured also depends on the weather, with VMC recodinng the highest numbers of Injured and Uninjured people . IMC show low records of the people injured and Uninjured probably due to less number of flights taken in the bad weather conditions.

## Conclusion

1. Aircraft models showing higher severity rates ought to be avoided or thorough scrutinized for underlying factors before investors purchase them.
2.  Weather conditions have an impact on accident outcomes.
3. Fluctuations of numbers of people Injured over time indicate a need for continuous monitoring and improvements in safety protocols over time.
